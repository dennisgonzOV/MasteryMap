- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, async/await patterns

### File Organization
- **Frontend**: One React component per file in `client/src/`
- **Backend**: Express routes in `server/routes.ts`, services in separate files
- **Shared**: Database schema and types in `shared/schema.ts`
- **Components**: Feature-based organization under `client/src/components/`

### Current Project Structure:
```
├── client/src/
│   ├── components/         # Reusable UI components
│   ├── pages/             # Page-level components
│   ├── hooks/             # Custom React hooks
│   └── lib/               # Utilities and configurations
├── server/                # Express.js backend
├── shared/                # Shared types and schemas
└── documentation/         # Project documentation
```

## 2. Database & Schema Management

### Current Implementation:
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Schema**: Centralized in `shared/schema.ts` with Zod validation
- **Migrations**: Use `npm run db:push` for schema deployment
- **Types**: Auto-generated types with `createInsertSchema` and `$inferSelect`

### Best Practices:
- **Never edit the schema directly in production**
- **Always use the storage interface for database operations**
- **Maintain referential integrity with proper foreign keys**
- **Use `serial` for auto-incrementing primary keys**
- **Array columns**: Use `.array()` method, not wrapper function

### Current Schema Structure (16 Core Tables):
- **XQ Competency Framework**: learner_outcomes (5) → competencies (28) → component_skills (80)
- **School Organization**: schools table with user association and data isolation
- **Authentication**: users, auth_tokens with JWT refresh token management
- **Project Management**: projects, milestones, project_assignments with AI milestone generation
- **Team Collaboration**: project_teams, project_team_members with dynamic membership
- **Assessment System**: assessments with 5-letter share codes and component skill tracking
- **Grading**: submissions, grades with XQ rubric levels and AI feedback integration
- **Credential System**: credentials (3-tier: stickers, badges, plaques)
- **Digital Portfolio**: portfolio_artifacts with QR code generation capabilities

---

## 3. Authentication & Security

### Current Implementation:
- **JWT Tokens**: Access tokens with refresh token rotation
- **Storage**: HTTP-only cookies for security
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based with connect-pg-simple
- **Password Security**: bcryptjs with salt rounds

### Security Rules:
- **Never store JWT secrets in client-side code**
- **Use middleware for route protection** (`requireAuth`, `requireRole`)
- **Validate all inputs** with Zod schemas before database operations
- **Maintain school-based data isolation**
- **Hash passwords** before storing in database

### Middleware Usage:
```typescript
// Protect routes requiring authentication
app.get('/api/protected', requireAuth, handler);

// Protect routes requiring specific roles
app.post('/api/admin', requireAuth, requireRole(['admin']), handler);
```

## 4. AI Integration Guidelines

### Current Implementation:
- **Service**: OpenAI GPT-4o API (latest model released May 2024) for intelligent content generation
- **Features**: AI milestone generation, assessment question creation, personalized feedback, credential suggestions
- **Prompt Management**: Structured prompts with JSON response formatting and validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry logic and graceful fallbacks for API failures
- **Date Constraints**: Intelligent date validation for milestone scheduling within project timelines

### AI Development Rules:
- **Always use GPT-4o** (newest model, not GPT-4)
- **Validate AI responses** with JSON schemas
- **Handle API failures** gracefully with user feedback
- **Include date constraints** for milestone generation
- **Sanitize AI outputs** before storing in database

### Example AI Integration:
```typescript
// Always specify the newest model
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o", // newest OpenAI model released May 13, 2024
  messages: [...],
  response_format: { type: "json_object" }
});
```

- **Return proper HTTP status codes** (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- **Log errors** but don't expose sensitive information to clients
- **Implement role-based authorization** for sensitive operations

### Example API Pattern:
```typescript
app.post('/api/resource', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const data = insertSchema.parse(req.body);
    const result = await storage.createResource(data);
    res.status(201).json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating resource:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: "Failed to create resource" });
  }
});
```
