### Assessments and Grading

- Create/update/delete assessments
- Standalone and milestone-linked assessments
- Generate AI assessments from component skills and standards context
- Generate AI question sets for assessment authoring flows
- Attach/read assessment PDFs used for AI generation and tutor context
- Generate/regenerate share codes
- Export assessment results/submissions as CSV
- Grade submissions with rubric data
- Generate question-level feedback
- Background auto-grading path for newly submitted teacher assessments

### Classroom and School Views

- Teacher dashboard endpoints (stats, projects, pending tasks, current milestones)
- School student list/progress endpoints (tier-gated)
- School component-skill progress/stats endpoints (tier-gated)
- Student competency/deadline compatibility endpoints used by dashboard flows

## 5. Admin Features

- Manage users in admin's school
- Create users (single and bulk)
- Delete users
- Reset user passwords
- View admin analytics endpoints
- Retrieve school user lists through admin-scoped endpoints

## 6. Platform-Wide Features

### AI Tutor

- AI tutor chat endpoint for student/teacher assessment support
- Tutor safety flag handling that can trigger safety incident notifications/workflows

### Competency Framework

- Learner outcomes hierarchy endpoints
- Competency/component-skill lookup endpoints
- B.E.S.T. standards metadata/filter/lookup endpoints

### Credentials

- Student credential retrieval
- Teacher credential stats retrieval
- Credential awarding endpoint

### Notifications and Safety

- User notifications retrieval and mark-read actions
- Safety incident listing/creation/status/resolve endpoints
- Safety incident creation paths triggered by AI tutor and self-evaluation analysis

### File Uploads and Objects

- Upload files for deliverables/assessment PDFs
- Serve stored objects via `/objects/*`

## 7. Tier-Based Behavior

Tier (`free` vs `enterprise`) affects access in multiple teacher/admin routes.

Examples of tier-gated areas:

- Teacher dashboard API group (`/api/teacher/*`)
- School analytics/progress endpoints
- Some team-management and export flows
- Project idea monthly generation limits for free-tier users

## 8. Current Constraints and Notes

- API response envelope is mixed: some routes return `{ success, data }`, others return raw JSON payloads.
- Not all feature paths are available in all roles/tiers even if endpoint exists.
- AI-dependent features require configured AI credentials and are rate-limited.
