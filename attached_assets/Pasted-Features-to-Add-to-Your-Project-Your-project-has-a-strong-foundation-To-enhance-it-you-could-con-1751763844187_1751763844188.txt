Features to Add to Your Project:

Your project has a strong foundation. To enhance it, you could consider adding the following features, which are based on your project's documentation but do not appear to be fully implemented yet:

Advanced Progress Tracking: You can enhance your project by adding more detailed progress-tracking features. This could include visual progress bars for milestones and tasks, allowing both students and teachers to get a quick overview of their progress.

A More Robust Grading Interface: Your documentation mentions a grading interface aligned with XQ rubric levels. You can expand on this by creating a more user-friendly interface for teachers to grade assessments, providing rubric-aligned feedback.

A Comprehensive Feedback System: You can implement a system that allows for both AI-generated and manual feedback from teachers. This would provide students with more comprehensive and personalized feedback on their work.

A Real-Time Notification System: A notification system would be a great addition to your project. It could alert users to new assignments, approaching deadlines, and new feedback, helping them stay on top of their work.

Digital Portfolios with QR Code Sharing: You can add a feature that automatically compiles student work into a digital portfolio. This could include a QR code sharing option, making it easy for students to share their work with others.

An Analytics Dashboard for Admins: An analytics dashboard would be a valuable tool for school administrators, allowing them to track usage metrics and evaluate the performance of the platform.

Enhanced Collaboration Tools: To foster collaboration, you could add features such as group project assignments and a peer feedback system.

Bugs That May Need to be Resolved:

Here are a few potential bugs and areas for improvement that I've identified in your code:

Inconsistent Authentication Redirects: The redirects for unauthorized access are currently hardcoded to /api/login in several places. It would be beneficial to centralize this, so that you can easily update the redirect path in the future.

Use of Mock Data: In several places, your application uses mock data for things like project progress, roles, and deadlines. This should be replaced with actual data from your backend to ensure that the application is fully functional.

Missing Error Handling: Some of your backend routes could benefit from more comprehensive error handling. For example, in the /api/projects/:id/generate-milestones route, there is no specific error handling for when the OpenAI API call fails.

Potential for SQL Injection: While you are using an ORM, it's always a good practice to review your database queries to ensure that all user inputs are properly sanitized. This will help to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Missing key Prop in React Components: In several of your React components, you are mapping over an array to render a list of elements without providing a key prop. This can lead to performance issues and unexpected behavior in your application.

Unused Files: Your changelog mentions the removal of several unused files. It would be a good idea to do another review of your project to ensure that there are no other unnecessary files that can be removed.
