## Architecture Assessment (July 29, 2025)

### Current State Analysis
The application has grown to 26,000+ lines of TypeScript code with robust features but faces modularity challenges:

**Critical Files Requiring Modularization:**
- `server/routes.ts`: 2,558 lines (all API endpoints)
- `server/storage.ts`: 1,152 lines (all database operations)  
- `server/openai.ts`: 896 lines (AI service logic)
- Several React components: 800+ lines each

### Modularity Recommendations
**Priority: High** - Backend domain modularization for easier Replit updates:
1. **Domain-Driven Structure**: Split monolithic files by business domains (auth, projects, assessments, credentials, portfolio)
2. **Service Layer Pattern**: Separate controllers, services, and repositories
3. **Schema Modularization**: Split large schema file by domain

**Benefits for Replit:**
- Smaller, focused files (200-300 lines vs 2,500+ lines)
- Isolated changes reduce update conflicts
- Faster hot module replacement and navigation
- Parallel development capability
