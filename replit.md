## Recent Changes

### Complete Domain-Driven Architecture Migration (August 2025)

**COMPLETED**: Successfully transformed the entire monolithic server codebase into a clean, domain-driven architecture by systematically extracting all functionality from large monolithic files into organized domain modules.

**Migration Summary**:
- **AI Domain**: Created comprehensive 2-layer AI architecture with `openai.service.ts` (low-level API wrapper) and `ai.service.ts` (high-level business logic)
- **New Domains Created**: competencies (5 routes), notifications (3 routes), safety-incidents (3 routes)
- **Routes Transformation**: Replaced monolithic `server/routes.ts` (251 lines) with new modular structure that mounts all 8 domain routers
- **Service Integration**: Updated existing domain services to use new AI services instead of old `server/openai.ts`
- **File Cleanup**: Deleted original monolithic files: `server/routes-backup.ts`, `server/storage.ts`, `server/openai.ts`, `server/services/openai.ts`

**Architecture Achievement**: 
- **8 Complete Domains**: auth, projects, assessments, credentials, portfolio, ai, competencies, notifications, safety-incidents
- **Consistent Pattern**: Each domain follows controller (routing) → service (business logic) → storage (database) layers
- **Clean Separation**: Business logic, data access, and route handling completely separated across all domains
- **Zero Monoliths**: No remaining monolithic files, fully modularized backend

**Technical Results**:
- Server running successfully with all domain routers properly mounted
