## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI**: Radix UI, shadcn/ui components, Apple-inspired Tailwind CSS design
- **State Management**: React Query
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Architecture**: Domain-driven modular design with domain-specific organization
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT-based system with bcryptjs for password hashing and PostgreSQL-based sessions (fully modularized in auth domain)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for content generation and feedback

### Database Strategy
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL dialect)
- **Connection**: Neon Database serverless
- **Schema**: Centralized with Drizzle Kit for migrations. Modularity efforts focus on splitting large schema files by domain for better maintainability.

### Core Features
- **Authentication**: Role-based access (Admin, Teacher, Student) with secure JWT and session management.
- **AI Integration**: Powers automated milestone generation, assessment creation, personalized feedback, and credential recommendations.
- **Project Management**: Teacher-initiated project creation with competency mapping, AI-generated/manual milestones, student assignment, and real-time progress tracking.
- **Assessment Module**: Dynamic AI-powered question generation, XQ competency-based rubric integration, teacher-friendly grading, and automated/manual feedback.
- **Credential System**: Hierarchy of Stickers (Outcomes) → Badges (Competencies) → Plaques (Subjects) with AI-suggested awarding and teacher approval.
- **Digital Portfolio**: Automatic collection of milestone deliverables, curation tools, and public sharing via QR codes.
- **Team Management**: Functionality for creating and managing student project teams, including student assignment and team member removal.
- **Assessment Code Sharing**: 5-letter share code system for students to access assessments, replacing URL-based sharing for improved security.

### Design Decisions
- **Domain-Driven Architecture**: Backend organized into domain modules (`server/domains/auth/`) with clear separation of concerns: storage, service, and controller layers
- **Modularity**: Each domain contains its own storage interface, business logic service, and Express router for complete encapsulation
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic separated from route handlers and database operations for better testability and maintainability
- **UI/UX**: Clean, intuitive interface inspired by Apple's design principles, prioritizing ease of use for educators and students
